Welcome to Bottlerocket's admin container!

This container provides access to the Bottlerocket host filesystems (see
/.bottlerocket/rootfs) and contains common tools for inspection and
troubleshooting.  It is based on Amazon Linux 2, and most things are in the
same places you would find them on an AL2 host.

To permit more intrusive troubleshooting, including actions that mutate the
running state of the Bottlerocket host, we provide a tool called "sheltie"
(`sudo sheltie`).  When run, this tool drops you into a root shell in the
Bottlerocket host's root filesystem.
